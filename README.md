I want to create an Golang based roguelike game using the ebiten library. I want to include the features from normal roguelikes like turn based combat, lighting and FOV, stats and character progression and procedural generation. 

## Features

### UI
Using the Code Page 437 tile set in the png file. 
The UI should be comprised of 3 areas:
- Gamescreen
  - a square window top left justified in the game window that displays the character and the local game world
  - a right hand panel for character stats
  - a bottom panel for game messages


### MOVEMENT
Movement should use the arrows keys for now.
